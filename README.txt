WPfooter allows you to add custom code and text such as tracking pixels, analytics or copyright notices to the footer of your site.

== Description ==

WPfooter makes it easy to add custom code and text to the bottom of every page on your site.

This is great for adding things like google analytics code, retargeting tracking, conversion pixels or just a simple copyright notice.

By pasting the raw code from your tracking pixels into the footer it will speed up a wordpress site which is dependant on different plugins for each tracking system.

You can also hide the default "Powered by..." or "Theme design by..." link at the bottom of the page and add your own as you wish.
